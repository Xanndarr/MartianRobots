# MartianRobots
A Ruby implementation of the developer programming problem Martian Robots from Red Badger

# Usage
ruby MartianRobots.rb {input_file} {?"DEBUG"}

e.g. ruby MartianRobots.rb sample/in/sample.in

You can run tests by moving into the "sample" dir and then running ./tests

This will run a simple test script, comparing some example inputs to outputs.
I decided to test the solution this way because I had already created example input and output files.

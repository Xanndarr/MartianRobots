Robot:
	Position:
		int x
		int y
		enum orientation {N, S, E, W}
	bool lost?

Instruction:
	 string instruction
	 {L, R, F}	<== Possibly requires expansion in future.

Grid:			<== 0,0 is lower left. x,y is upper right.
	int height
	int width
	hash pos => scent(bool)		<== should default to false

Main:
	Input:
		1. upper-right co-ords of grid.
		2. Robot position + instr ...
			Line 1: Robot Position. e.g. 2 4 N		<== max 50, 50
			Line 2: Instructions. e.g RLRRFFRLR		<== max.length 100



Control Flow:

	Main. Take input.
	Create Grid.
	Create Robots.
	Add Robots to Grid.
	For each robot
		run instructions on robot.
	end.
	Ask each robot for its position and state.
	Generate output for robots.
